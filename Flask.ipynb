    "## Web API\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. What is a Web API?\n",
    "\n",
    "A Web API (Application Programming Interface) is an interface that allows different software applications to communicate with each other over the web. It defines the methods and data formats that applications can use to request and exchange information.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. How does a Web API differ from a web service?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Web API**: Typically refers to RESTful APIs that use HTTP protocols and return data in formats like JSON or XML.\n",
    "- **Web Service**: A broader term that includes any service available over the web, including SOAP-based services, RESTful services, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. What are the benefits of using Web APIs in software development?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Interoperability**: Allows different systems to work together.\n",
    "- **Scalability**: Easily scalable to handle more requests.\n",
    "- **Flexibility**: Can be used across different platforms and devices.\n",
    "- **Reusability**: APIs can be reused across multiple projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Explain the difference between SOAP and RESTful APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **SOAP**: A protocol that uses XML for message formatting and relies on WSDL for service description. It is more rigid and has built-in error handling.\n",
    "- **RESTful APIs**: Use standard HTTP methods and are stateless. They are more flexible and typically use JSON for data exchange.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. What is JSON and how is it commonly used in Web APIs?\n",
    "\n",
    "JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate. It is commonly used in Web APIs for data exchange.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example of JSON\n",
    "import json\n",
    "\n",
    "data = {\n",
    "    \"name\": \"John\",\n",
    "    \"age\": 30,\n",
    "    \"city\": \"New York\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "json_data = json.dumps(data)\n",
